# How to Science

This is the first draft of an evolving guide on how to participate in Ryan Abernathey's research group.

## Core Principles
1. **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
1. **Work hard**: we are all here because we are passionate about science and want to make a big impact on our field.
   This requires working with a sense of urgency.
1. **Communicate with the group**: participate in group events, be present at the office, and be available via
   communication channels.  
1. **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

These principles are explained in more specific detail below. 

## Code of Conduct

All Columbia university employees and students must understand and comply with the University's
policies and procedures regarding harassment and discrimination
([for employees](http://www.essential-policies.columbia.edu/policies-and-procedures-discrimination-and-harassment);
[for students](http://www.essential-policies.columbia.edu/gender-based-misconduct-policies-students)).
Prof. Abernathey is a *mandatory reporter* and will report any incidents of
harassment or misconduct that violate these policies. In addition to these formal procedures, our group adopts additional informal 
guidelines on conduct adapted from the [Left Logic code of conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) which may go beyond
the University's policies.

### The Quick Version

Our group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or political views. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any professional context, including group meetings, individual meetings,
conferences, online communications, and work-related social events. Anyone violating these rules may be temporarily suspended
or permanetly expelled from the group, at the discretion of the group leader Ryan Abernathey. 

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, political views, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts,
or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
